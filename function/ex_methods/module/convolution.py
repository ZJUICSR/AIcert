class Conv3d(_ConvNd):
    r"""Applies a 3D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size :math:`(N, C_{in}, D, H, W)`
    and output :math:`(N, C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` can be precisely described as:

    .. math::

        \begin{equation*}
        \text{out}(N_i, C_{out_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{out_j}) +
                                \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{in} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{out_j}, k) \star \text{input}(N_i, k)
        \end{equation*},

    where :math:`\star` is the valid 3D `cross-correlation`_ operator

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for :attr:`padding` number of points for each dimension.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the Ã  trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{\text{out_channels}}{\text{in_channels}}\right\rfloor`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the depth, height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of three ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the depth dimension,
          the second `int` for the height dimension and the third `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::

         The configuration when `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`
         where `K` is a positive integer is termed in literature as depthwise convolution.

         In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`, if you want a
         depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K`,
         then you use the constructor arguments
         :math:`(\text{in_channels}=C_{in}, \text{out_channels}=C_{in} * K, ..., \text{groups}=C_{in})`

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): Zero-padding added to all three sides of the input. Default: 0

        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input channels to output channels. Default: 1

                    \times (\text{kernel_size}[0] - 1) - 1}{\text{stride}[0]} + 1\right\rfloor

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv3d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation).

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for ``kernel_size - 1 - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the Ã  trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{\text{out_channels}}{\text{in_channels}}\right\rfloor`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`output_padding`
    can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the depth, height and width dimensions
        - a ``tuple`` of three ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the depth dimension,
          the second `int` for the height dimension and the third `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``kernel_size - 1 - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv3d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv3d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): ``kernel_size - 1 - padding`` zero-padding
            will be added to both sides of each dimension in the input. Default: 0
        output_padding (int or tuple, optional): Additional size added to one side
            of each dimension in the output shape. Default: 0
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input channels to output channels. Default: 1
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: ``True``
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): Spacing between kernel elements. Default: 1

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` where

          .. math::
              D_{out} = (D_{in} - 1) \times \text{stride}[0] - 2 \times \text{padding}[0]
                    + \text{kernel_size}[0] + \text{output_padding}[0]

                    + \text{kernel_size}[1] + \text{output_padding}[1]

              W_{out} = (W_{in} - 1) \times \text{stride}[2] - 2 \times \text{padding}[2]
                    + \text{kernel_size}[2] + \text{output_padding}[2]

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
                         (in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1], kernel_size[2])
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_channels)

    Examples::

        >>> # With square kernels and equal stride
        >>> m = nn.ConvTranspose3d(16, 33, 3, stride=2)
        >>> # non-square kernels and unequal stride and with padding
        >>> m = nn.Conv3d(16, 33, (3, 5, 2), stride=(2, 1, 1), padding=(0, 4, 2))
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 10, 50, 100)
        >>> output = m(input)
