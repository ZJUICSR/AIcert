    MultiAttack is a class to attack a model with various attacks agains same images and labels.

    Arguments:
        model (nn.Module): model to attack.
        attacks (list): list of attacks.
          
    Examples::
        >>> attack1 = torchattacks.PGD(model, eps=4/255, alpha=8/255, iters=40, random_start=False)
        >>> attack2 = torchattacks.PGD(model, eps=4/255, alpha=8/255, iters=40, random_start=False)
