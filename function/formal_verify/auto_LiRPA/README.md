## Introduction

`auto_LiRPA` is a library for automatically deriving and computing bounds with
linear relaxation based perturbation analysis (LiRPA) (e.g.
[CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00866.pdf) and
[DeepPoly](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/DeepPoly.pdf)) for
neural networks, which is an useful tool for formal robustness verification. We
generalize existing LiRPA algorithms for feed-forward neural networks to a
graph algorithm on general computational graphs, defined by PyTorch.
Additionally, our implementation is also automatically **differentiable**,
allowing optimizing network parameters to shape the bounds into certain
specifications (e.g., certified defense). You can find [a video ▶️ introduction
here](http://PaperCode.cc/AutoLiRPA-Video).

Our library supports the following algorithms:

* Backward mode LiRPA bound propagation ([CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00866.pdf)/[DeepPoly](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/DeepPoly.pdf))
* Backward mode LiRPA bound propagation with optimized bounds ([α-CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13824.pdf))
* Backward mode LiRPA bound propagation with split constraints ([β-CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06624.pdf))
* Forward mode LiRPA bound propagation ([Xu et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12920))
* Forward mode LiRPA bound propagation with optimized bounds (similar to [α-CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13824.pdf))
* Interval bound propagation ([IBP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12715.pdf))
* Hybrid approaches, e.g., Forward+Backward, IBP+Backward ([CROWN-IBP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06316.pdf)), [α,β-CROWN](https://github.com/huanzhang12/alpha-beta-CROWN.git) ([alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/huanzhang12/alpha-beta-CROWN.git))

Our library allows automatic bound derivation and computation for general
computational graphs, in a similar manner that gradients are obtained in modern
deep learning frameworks -- users only define the computation in a forward
pass, and `auto_LiRPA` traverses through the computational graph and derives
bounds for any nodes on the graph.  With `auto_LiRPA` we free users from
deriving and implementing LiPRA for most common tasks, and they can simply
apply LiPRA as a tool for their own applications.  This is especially useful
for users who are not experts of LiRPA and cannot derive these bounds manually
(LiRPA is significantly more complicated than backpropagation).

## Technical Background in 1 Minute

Deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch represent neural networks (NN) as
a computational graph, where each mathematical operation is a node and edges
define the flow of computation:

</p>

Normally, the inputs of a computation graph (which defines a NN) are data and
model weights, and PyTorch goes through the graph and produces model prediction
(a bunch of numbers):

</p>

Our `auto_LiRPA` library conducts perturbation analysis on a computational
graph, where the input data and model weights are defined within some
user-defined ranges.  We get guaranteed output ranges (bounds):

</p>

## Installation

Python 3.7+ is required. Pytorch 1.8 (LTS) is recommended, although a newer
version might also work. You can install `auto_LiRPA` via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaidiXu/auto_LiRPA
cd auto_LiRPA
python setup.py install
```

If you intend to modify this library, use `python setup.py develop` instead.

## Quick Start

First define your computation as a `nn.Module` and wrap it using
`auto_LiRPA.BoundedModule()`. Then, you can call the `compute_bounds` function
to obtain certified lower and upper bounds under input perturbations:

```python
from auto_LiRPA import BoundedModule, BoundedTensor, PerturbationLpNorm

# Define computation as a nn.Module.
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Define your computation here.

model = MyModel()
my_input = load_a_batch_of_data()
# Wrap the model with auto_LiRPA.
model = BoundedModule(model, my_input)
# Define perturbation. Here we add Linf perturbation to input data.
ptb = PerturbationLpNorm(norm=np.inf, eps=0.1)
# Make the input a BoundedTensor with the pre-defined perturbation.
my_input = BoundedTensor(my_input, ptb)
# Regular forward propagation using BoundedTensor works as usual.
prediction = model(my_input)
# Compute LiRPA bounds using the backward mode bound propagation (CROWN).
lb, ub = model.compute_bounds(x=(my_input,), method="backward")
```

Checkout

for a complete but very basic example.

We also provide a [Google Colab Demo](http://PaperCode.cc/AutoLiRPA-Demo) including an example of computing verification
bounds for a 18-layer ResNet model on CIFAR-10 dataset. Once the ResNet model
is defined as usual in Pytorch, obtaining provable output bounds is as easy as
obtaining gradients through autodiff. Bounds are efficiently computed on GPUs.
